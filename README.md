### What it is
GPConverter is a general-purpose file converter that can be used to convert audio, video or image file formats. For example, converting a .heic image file into .png. 
The program currently only supports image file conversions.


### Usage
GPConverter is currently only able to be used through the console. The program will ask the user to define the file type (without the period) of the files being converted, and the file type to which they will be converted to. After the user has selected the files, the program will proceed with the conversion and store the converted files in a dedicated output folder. 
The program can also be used by passing it the appropriate parameters in the terminal, type "help" for instructions.
